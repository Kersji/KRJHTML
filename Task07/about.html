        <h3><b>What is the Rate of Change of Momentum?</b></h3>
        <u>Momentum</u> is the quantity of motion and the volume of matter 
        moved and the velocity at which it travels is multiplied. <br/> 
        If the net external force acting on a body is zero, so the rate of 
        momentum change is also zero, meaning there is no momentum change.
